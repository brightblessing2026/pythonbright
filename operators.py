#Arithmatic Operations - Simple calculations

x = 20
y = 6


print(x + y )
print(x - y )
print(x * y )
print(x / y )
print(x % y ) # Modulus - Returns remainder after division


#Comparison Operators
print(x < y)
print(x > y)
print(x <= y)
print(x >= y)
print(x == y) #Equal to
print(x != y) #Not Equal to
